# Changelog

## Hardware TODO

- Move v0.2's PCB fingers 18.0mm from the center of 3.5mm mounting holes, and 0.5mm from board edge, for slightly better engagement with the Vectrex cartrdige connector.
- Remove soldermask from PCB cart fingers on top and bottom of the board.
- R4 & D3 reference designators are swapped.
- Remove D4 - D6 and just have addressible LEDs on the edge of the board, space the 7 LEDs evenly.
- Move the debugging/serial port connector so it does not interfere with enclosure bosses.
- Move V-HALT and V-CE to different pins and fix SDAT and SCLK so they are on SPI2 for hardware control. V-CE might be optimized for MSB (seems like it is in romemu.S), so move to PA15 which bumps CSn to some other pin? CSn should likely be on SPI1_SS, but it might not matter (check).  PB01 is used in an optimized way as well though.
- Replace U3 with a single OR gate?
- Replacement for U4 which is more available at LCSC?
- Slightly increase the middle pads on addressible LEDs so they don't require touch up soldering

## Software TODO

- Add hardware SPI2 support
- Add cartridge RAM support (specifically for Animaction $2000-$27FF, but possibly for others as well).  Any downside to letting the entire 64KB of emulated ROM to be considered as RAM and writable?
- Add hardware version support for pin definitions
- Add 128KB bankswitching (V-INT pin)
- Developer mode, allow the cart to stay plugged into a computer and appear as a RAMDISK.

## v0.2

- Replaced USB-B-mini with USB-C and centered USB on cart
- Extended the PCB by 1.7 mm to get the USB-C connector as close to the case exterior as possible.
- Widened the PCB to 48.0 mm so that there’s less side to side play in the cartridge slot.
- Moved outer mounting holes into the proper locations
- Reversed D3 and R4 order to get D3 closer to edge of the PCB, but it turned out we added something else there!
- Added 10 APA102-2020 addressable RGB LED lights (max. draw 245mA) … qualify with USB-IN (PA9) for 100% brightness, else 50%
- Added 47uF cap for peak currents required for RGB LEDs.
- Added V-IRQ connection to PB9 for 128KB bank-switching
- Grounded unused floating inputs on U3 to reduce current consumption
- Adjusted Y1 to use 12pF load crystal resonator with 18pF load caps (see equation)
- Lots of clean up and tweaking all over PCB
- Added revision to PCB
- Added “VEXTREME” to PCB
- Added a ground pour under the STM32
- Made the contacts on the edge connector thinner (1.52mm) and made sure they were spaced properly (2.54mm).
- Started moving footprints to the libs/veccart.pretty library so you know where they will be!
- Add basic folder support #1
- Ignore dotfiles generated by MacOS
- Add software driven addressible LED support

## v0.1

- Mostly unchanged from Sprite_tm's original HW/SW design
- Mostly unchanged from Rattboi's original PCB design
- fixes error opening PCB with latest KiCaD
- add gerbers for easy PCB ordering at many places
- update README.md and add LICENSE
- fixes premature automatic reset delay on GCE Vectrex
- fixes menu builder missing filename in path
- pretty up the menu by removing the .BIN file extension, and other cleanup
- let's call it the VEXTREME cart, for now. (original name was EXTREME)
