Based on [FrankBuss/bloxorz](https://github.com/FrankBuss/bloxorz)'s kicad PCB design (cart pins, edge cuts, case holes, mostly)

This is an attempt to recreate the work of [SpritesMods](http://spritesmods.com/?art=veccart&page=1)'s reflashable Vectrex cart. He posted the code and lots of screens of the PCB/initial schematic, but he never released the PCB. Once recreated, it looks like a good base for cheaper multicart, and programmers cart.
